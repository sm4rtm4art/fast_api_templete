**CURRENT ISSUE (JWT Validation Error - NEEDS FIX)**

When running tests, the application fails with the following error:

```
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for JWTSettings
secret_key
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]
```

**SOLUTION NEEDED:**

- Similar to how we fixed the DatabaseSettings by adding a default SQLite URL, we need to add a default JWT secret_key for testing environments
- Modify the JWTSettings class in fast_api_template/config/settings.py to provide a non-empty default value for secret_key
- Ensure the default is clearly marked as only for testing/development and not for production use

**RESUMPTION PROMPT:** `Let's fix the JWTSettings validation error by adding a secure default secret_key for testing environments in the settings.py file.`

**CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS (Dockerfile CI Debug - RESOLVED)**

- **Problem (FIXED):** Docker build in GitHub Actions was failing with multiple issues:

  1. Initial error: The scripts directory wasn't found in the builder stage
  2. Second error: Requirements installation failed due to reference to the local project
  3. Current error: Project installation with `pip install -e .` failing with metadata generation error:

  ```
  error: metadata-generation-failed
  Encountered error while generating package metadata.
  ```

- **Solution Implemented:**

  1. **Fixed Module Compatibility** - Added ModuleConfig as an alias for PydanticModuleConfig to maintain backward compatibility
  2. **Fixed Database Connection** - Updated database.py to conditionally use SQLite-specific connect_args only for SQLite connections
  3. **Verified Docker Functionality** - Successfully tested the Docker setup with `make docker-build` and `make docker-run`
  4. **Confirmed API Accessibility** - The API endpoint is now accessible at http://localhost:8000/health

- **Next Steps:**

  1. **Update ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md** to reflect the current project structure (which now uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.py)
  2. **Update HISTORY.md** with recent changes
  3. **Review PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** for accuracy with current implementation

    - [ ] **Next Steps (Dependency Vulnerabilities):**
      - **1. Analyze Usage:** Use search/grep to find exactly where `python-jose` and `ecdsa` are used in the codebase (`fast_api_template/auth` seems likely).
      - **2. Research Vulnerabilities:** Look up the specific CVEs (CVE-2024-33664, CVE-2024-33663 for `python-jose`; CVE-2024-23342, PVE-2024-64396 for `ecdsa`) to understand the risks and if they apply to our usage patterns.
      - **3. Evaluate Alternatives:** Research potential replacement libraries for JWT handling (e.g., `PyJWT`, `Authlib`) and ECDSA operations if necessary. Consider ease of migration, features, and maintenance status.
      - **4. Plan Migration:** If replacement is needed, outline the steps to swap the libraries, update function calls, and adjust tests.
      - **Resumption Prompt:** `Let's resume the security enhancement task. Start by searching the codebase to confirm where python-jose and ecdsa are being used.`
