# FastAPI Template Improvement Plan

---

**CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS (Dockerfile CI Debug)**

- **Problem:** The GitHub Actions Docker build (commit `72669e8`) is still failing when the final stage tries to copy the script from the builder stage. The specific error is:
  ```
  #23 [final  6/11] COPY --from=builder /app/scripts/entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh
  #23 ERROR: failed to calculate checksum of ref ...: "/app/scripts/entrypoint.sh": not found
  ------
   > [final  6/11] COPY --from=builder /app/scripts/entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh:
  ------
  Dockerfile:78
  --------------------
    76 |
    77 |     # Copy only the necessary files from the builder stage.
    78 | >>> COPY --from=builder /app/scripts/entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh
    79 |     RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh
    80 |     COPY --from=builder /app/pyproject.toml /app/
  --------------------
  ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref ...: "/app/scripts/entrypoint.sh": not found
  Error: buildx failed with: ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref ...: "/app/scripts/entrypoint.sh": not found
  ```
  This happens despite the builder stage explicitly running `COPY scripts ./scripts`, which _should_ create `/app/scripts/entrypoint.sh`. This indicates a persistent, unexplained discrepancy between the local build environment and the GitHub Actions runner environment regarding Docker build context or filesystem state between stages.
- **Goal:** Diagnose why the explicitly copied `/app/scripts/entrypoint.sh` file is not available/visible when the final stage attempts to copy it from the builder stage within the GitHub Actions environment.
- **Next Debug Steps:**
  1.  **Add CI Debugging:** Modify the CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml`) in the `docker` and `trivy` jobs. _Before_ the `docker/build-push-action` step, add a manual `run` step to `ls -la $GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and `ls -la $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/scripts` to definitively confirm the `scripts` directory and its contents exist in the checked-out code _before_ Docker build context is even created.
  2.  **Simplify Dockerfile (Temporarily):** If the files exist before the build, try drastically simplifying the `Dockerfile` for CI debugging. E.g., remove the `useradd`/`chown` step, remove the dependency installation, just focus on the `COPY scripts ./scripts` and a final `ls /app/scripts` in the builder to see if some other step interferes.
  3.  **Check Buildx/Runner Caching:** Investigate potential interactions with Docker Buildx caching (`cache-from: type=gha`, `cache-to: type=gha`) on the runner. Try disabling cache (`cache-from: type=registry,ref=...` or no cache) for a test run.
  4.  **Consider Runner Differences:** Research if there are known issues or differences with Docker contexts/volumes on the specific `ubuntu-latest` runner version being used.
- **Resumption Prompt:** `Let's resume debugging the Docker CI build failure. Start by adding 'ls' commands to the GitHub Actions workflow file before the Docker build step to verify the presence of the scripts directory in the checkout.`

      - **3. Evaluate Alternatives:** Research potential replacement libraries for JWT handling (e.g., `PyJWT`, `Authlib`) and ECDSA operations if necessary. Consider ease of migration, features, and maintenance status.
      - **4. Plan Migration:** If replacement is needed, outline the steps to swap the libraries, update function calls, and adjust tests.
      - **Resumption Prompt:** `Let's resume the security enhancement task. Start by searching the codebase to confirm where python-jose and ecdsa are being used.`
